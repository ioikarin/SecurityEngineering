# Tasks

### Task 1: Choose A ***or*** B

#### Task 1A: Browsers and Banking Security

Online Banking is of the most lucrative targets for phishing and scams. How do our browsers protect us against them?

Look at the following snippets from a browsers address bar:

### Task 3: Card Fraud

One part of understanding payment card security is monitoring how the cards are used for frauds. The following articles are reports on card fraud by the European Central Bank and will give you an overview of how the fraud landscape has evolved between 2008-2019. Read through the articles and then answer the questions in the questions section.

**Read the following reports:**


https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/cardfraud/cardfraudreport201207en.pdf  
https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/cardfraud/html/ecb.cardfraudreport202008~521edb602b.en.html  
https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/cardfraud/html/ecb.cardfraudreport202110~cac4c418e8.en.html  

**Supporting Resources:**

https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/mip-online/2018/html/1803_revisedpsd.en.html  


**Questions:**

Write a summary (max 700 words) on "Evolution of card fraud" in which you answer **at least** the following questions:

- What kinds of card fraud exist?
    - How does card fraud type prevalence differ geographically?
- How has the fraud landscape changed between 2008-2019? Why?
    - What type of fraud has seen a notable increase during the last decade?
    - What technologies or regulations have had an impact on card fraud?
- How has the transaction landscape changed in the same period?
    - What kind of transactions have become increasingly popular?
    - What kind of transactions have had a high risk of being fraudulent?
        - Has this changed at all during 2008-2019?
- What effect has internet and e-commerce had on card fraud?
- Why is preventing data breaches important in preventing card fraud?
    - How does payment card tokenisation help in this?
-Anything interesting you found?

### Task 4: [Wazuh](https://www.wazuh.com)

---

> **note**
> Task tested to work on v4.9.0, written and designed on v4.5.1. v4.9 has a couple of known issues with details being unable to be read from events. If you face issues, fallback to e.g v4.5.1, which still works.

---

Wazuh is an free and open source "unified XDR and SIEM protection for endpoints and cloud workloads." In this task we are going to focus more on the [SIEM](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/security-information-and-event-management-siem) side of things. Take a look at their [website](https://wazuh.com/platform/siem/) and [github](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh) to familiarize yourself with the capabilities and features Wazuh SIEM offers.

Start of with deploying the Wazuh [single-node on Docker](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/deployment-options/docker/wazuh-container.html). You should go through the documentation to understand what's going on, but the following commands should be enough:

```console
git clone https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker.git -b <VERSION NUMBER e.g v4.9.0 or v4.5.1>
cd wazuh-docker/single-node
docker-compose -f generate-indexer-certs.yml run --rm generator
docker-compose up -d
```

You can access the Wazuh (WUI)WebUI at your localhost, to do this go to [https://localhost](https://localhost). By default Wazuh uses self signed certs and you won't be directed to the site directly, instead click the advanced tab and find the button for "Accept the risk and continue". This will direct you to the site, and from then on you should be able to use it normally.

Next deploy an agent or agents. You can deploy the agent(s) on your own platform(server, desktop, etc...) or the course virtual machine. For the course virtual machine use the "installation from source" --> "installing Wazuh agent from sources". Arch linux, the course VM uses pacman for package management so you could use that. [Installation alternatives](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/deployment-options/wazuh-from-sources/wazuh-agent/index.html) in the documents.  

For other environments, find the appropriate [installation documention](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-agent/index.html), many can be installed in the Wazuh WUI(Web User Interface), for windows, choose windows and fill out the details, run the command and start the agent. For the ip address of the server, you can use your internal ip address.

Create a directory named integrity and add a file to it, then enable FIM(File Integrity Monitoring) on your agent(s) on that folder, you should also set the scan frequency at around 60 seconds, so you won't have to wait for the events. 

You are to trigger the FIM with atleast two different events. Then answer the questions below.

**What to return:**
1. What rule descriptions did you get?
2. What are the MITRE ATT&CK techniques(include ID) Wazuh reports for these events?
3. What is the reported MITRE techniques for deleting files or directories inside monitored directories?
4. Explain in your own words where, when and why should these systems be used, would they be helpful in banking.
5. Add a screenshot of your integrity monitoring events tab.

### Feedback
Be sure to give feedback on these tasks. Do you feel these to be the kind of skills you might need or want?
